<h1 id="Research">Research</h1>

<p>I am currently undertaking a multi-wavelength study of a sample of gravitationally lensed AGN in the high magnification regime, with a special focus on the analysis of Chandra data. The methods my collaborators and I are using can help unveil the presence of offsets between the optical/radio and X-ray emission regions in such AGN and also help identify binary and dual AGN candidates. 

<p> My Ph.D. focused on exploiting X-ray astronomy to probe nonstandard physics, namely: the parameter space of ultralight axions, which are well-motivated particles and compelling dark matter candidates, but as yet undetected; and the spin of massive black holes in AGN. My doctoral thesis set (i) some of the tightest constraints to date on the interaction of ultralight axions with photons and (ii) the only well-defined spin constraint for a very massive black hole studied with X-ray reflection spectroscopy to date.

<p> I am broadly interested in topics concerning the hot and energetic universe and non-standard physics, including: dual and binary AGN and radio jets in AGN; the physics of galaxy clusters; accretion onto compact objects, including massive black holes; AGN feedback; and dark matter and ultralight boson searches.
