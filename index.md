I am an astronomer and, as of September 2024, a postdoctoral research fellow at the Center for Astrophysics (CfA) at the Harvard & Smithsonian in Cambridge, MA. I analyze multi-wavelength observations of gravitationally lensed and distant active galactic nuclei (AGN) so as to perform astrometric determinations. I focus on exploiting the use of archival observations taken with the Chandra X-ray telescope. The methods my collaborators and myself are using can help unveil the presence of offsets between the optical/radio and X-ray emission regions in these distant AGN, and also help identify dual and binary AGN candidates.

In July 2024, I completed a Ph.D. in astronomy at the Institute of Astronomy, The University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK. My Ph.D. work centered on exploiting high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy of AGN to unveil fundamental physics, specifically: axions and the spin of massive black holes in AGN. An online copy of my Ph.D. thesis is available [here](https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/items/73316b31-4841-4c8f-a1f4-5a6c6fcb0735). Prior to my Ph.D., I earnt an Integrated Master’s in Physics –an MPhys (Hons) Physics– at The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK. For my master’s project, I developed an analytic model for predicting the thermal Sunyaev-Zel’dovich signal for different cluster pressure profiles.

I was raised in Mallorca, Spain, and I like to stay connected to my Spanish heritage by learning Latin dances and flamenco in my free time. I also help run and get involved in events targeted at disseminating scientific results with members of the general public.
