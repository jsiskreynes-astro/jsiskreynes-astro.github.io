Welcome! I am an astronomer and, as of September 2024, a postdoctoral research fellow at the Center for Astrophysics (CfA) at the Harvard & Smithsonian in Cambridge, MA. I analyze multi-wavelength observations of active galactic nuclei (AGN) that are gravitationally lensed so as to perform astrometric determinations. Specifically, I focus on exploiting the use of archival observations taken with the Chandra X-ray telescope of such AGN for this study. The methods I am using can help unveil the presence of offsets between the optical/radio and X-ray emission regions in these AGN, and help identify dual and binary AGN candidates. 

# # led if you liked it enough to use it as well! Installation and configuration instructions can be found in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/bencentra/centrarium).

I completed a Ph.D. in astronomy at the Institute of Astronomy at The University fo Cambridge in Cambridge, UK, in July 2024. My Ph.D. work centered on exploiting high-resoltuion X-ray spectroscopy of AGN to unveil fundamental physics, specifically: axion-like particles ("axion"), and the spin of massive black holes in AGN.
