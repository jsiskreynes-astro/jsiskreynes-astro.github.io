Welcome! I am an astronomer and, as of September 2024, a postdoctoral research fellow at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian (CfA) in Cambridge, MA. My primary work consists of analyzing multi-wavelength observations of gravitationally lensed quasars for astrometric determinations, with a focus on exploiting archival observations of these quasars taken bby the Chandra X-ray Observatory. The methods I am using can help unveil the presence of offsets between the optical/radio and X-ray emission regions in these AGN, and help identify dual and binary AGN candidates.
