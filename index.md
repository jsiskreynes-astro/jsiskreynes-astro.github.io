Welcome! I am an astronomer and, as of September 2024, a postdoctoral research fellow at the Center for Astrophysics (CfA) at the Harvard & Smithsonian in Cambridge, MA. I analyze multi-wavelength observations of active galactic nuclei (AGN) that are gravitationally lensed so as to perform astrometric determinations. Specifically, I focus on exploiting the use of archival observations taken with the Chandra X-ray telescope of such AGN for this study. The methods I am using can help unveil the presence of offsets between the optical/radio and X-ray emission regions in these AGN, and help identify dual and binary AGN candidates.

I completed a Ph.D. in astronomy at the Institute of Astronomy at The University fo Cambridge in Cambridge, UK, in July 2024. My Ph.D. work centered on exploiting high-resoltuion X-ray spectroscopy of AGN to unveil fundamental physics, specifically: axion-like particles ("axions"), and the spin of massive black holes in AGN. An online copy of my Ph.D. thesis can be accessed [here](https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/items/73316b31-4841-4c8f-a1f4-5a6c6fcb0735). Prior to moving to Cambridge, UK, I earnt an Integrated Master's in Physics (or MPhys Hons Physics) from The University of Manchester in Manchester, UK. For my master's, I focused on developing an analytic model for the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich signal which appears in the cosmic microwave background spectrum and depends on cluster pressure profiles. 

I was raised in Mallorca, Spain, and I like to keep in touch with my roots by learning latin dances and flamenco in my free time. I have two surnames: Sisk comes from my father, and Reyn√©s comes from my mother.
