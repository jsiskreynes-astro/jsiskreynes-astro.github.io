I joined the Center for Astrophysics (CfA) at the Harvard &amp; Smithsonian as a postdoctoral
research fellow in September 2024. I analyze multi-wavelength observations of gravitationally
lensed and distant active galactic nuclei (AGN) to perform astrometric determinations. I focus on
exploiting the use of archival observations taken with the Chandra X-ray telescope. The
methods my collaborators and I use can help unveil the presence of offsets between the
optical/radio and X-ray emission regions in these distant AGN and also help identify dual and
binary AGN candidates.

I completed a Ph.D. in astronomy at the Institute of Astronomy at The University of Cambridge
in July 2024. My doctoral research centered on exploiting high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy of
AGN to unveil fundamental physics, specifically: axions and the spin of massive black holes in
AGN. Prior to my Ph.D., I earned a Master’s in Physics at The University of Manchester in the
UK. For my master’s project, I developed an analytic model for predicting the thermal Sunyaev-
Zel’dovich signal for different cluster pressure profiles.

In my free time, I enjoy organising and getting involved in events targeted at disseminating scientific to members of the general public.
