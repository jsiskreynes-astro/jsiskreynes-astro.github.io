Welcome! I am an astronomer and, as of September 2024, a postdoctoral research fellow at the Center for Astrophysics (CfA) at the Harvard & Smithsonian in Cambridge, MA. I analyze multi-wavelength observations of gravittaionally lensed active galactic nuclei (AGN) so as to perform astrometric determinations. I specifically focus on exploiting the use of archival observations taken with the Chandra X-ray telescope. The methods myself and my group are using can help unveil the presence of offsets between the optical/radio and X-ray emission regions in these AGN, and also help identify dual and binary AGN candidates. 

I completed a Ph.D. in astronomy at the Institute of Astronomy at The University fo Cambridge in Cambridge, UK, in July 2024. My Ph.D. work centered on exploiting high-resoltuion X-ray spectroscopy of AGN to unveil fundamental physics, specifically: axion-like particles ("axions"), and the spin of massive black holes in AGN. An online copy of my Ph.D. thesis is available [here](https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/items/73316b31-4841-4c8f-a1f4-5a6c6fcb0735). Prior to starting my Ph.D., I was based in Manchester for four years, where I studied for an Integrated Master's in Physics -- and MPhys (Hons) Physics -- from The University of Manchester in Manchester. In my master's project, I developed an analytic model for the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich signal which appears in the cosmic microwave background power spectrum and depends on cluster pressure profiles. 

I was raised in Mallorca, Spain, and I like to keep in touch with my Spanish roots by learning latin dances and flamenco in my free time. I also like taking part and organizing events that help disseminate scientific results with members of the public. I have two surnames: Sisk, which comes from my father, and Reyn√©s, which comes from my mother.
