<p>If you would like to discuss science or are interested in working with me, please do not hesitate to contact me via e-mail at julia (dot) sisk (underscore) reynes (at) cfa (dot) harvard (dot) edu. 

<p> Equivalently, feel free to pop by my office (B-306A) if you’re around the CfA (60 Garden Street, Cambridge 02144, MA). 

<p> A note on my name: My first name is Júlia (although this is written in Catalan, this is pronounced the same as in English). I have two surnames: Sisk, which comes from my father and has an Irish origin, and Reynés, which comes from my mother and has a French origin.
